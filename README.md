# Nvim-config-backup

Warning: you may need some configurations before like:

* adding a nerdfont 
* adding python2 and python3 support (probably using pyenv)
* a clipboard manager supported
* I **trully** recommend using tmux or screen to multiplex your terminal. It makes faster and easier to execute many different tasks.

I won't link needed stuff here - usually I compile nvim with Release tag.

Last, but not least important: I use vim-plug to install my plugins and have fun :smile:

## Completion notes!

Some autocompletion tools requires installation without setup with `Lspinstall` - so, check within

[nvim-lspconfig repo](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
